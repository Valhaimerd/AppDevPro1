# Banking System  

The **Banking System Program** is designed to simulate a real-world banking system where users can create and manage bank accounts. This project helps understand how banking applications work while improving programming skills by implementing **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts, UML diagrams, and SOLID principles**.

## **Documentation**  

### **Added Methods/Functions**  

### **Account.java**  
1. **loadTransactionsFromDatabase()**  
   - The method was added to keep an accountâ€™s transaction history updated by automatically retrieving past transactions from a database. This amkes sure that it has accurate financial records without manual entry.
#### Funtionality
   - It clears the existing transaction list to avoid duplicates, fetches transactions from a log service using the account number, adds them back into the list, and prints the number of transactions loaded.

### **CreditAccount.java**  
1. **pay()**  
   -  allows a CreditAccount to send money to a SavingsAccount by checking if the credit limit allows the transaction. If the limit is exceeded, the payment fails. Otherwise, it processes the transfer through transactionService.creditPayment().
   -  It was added to allow credit accounts to make controlled payments while ensuring they do not exceed their borrowing limit.

2. **recompense()**  
   - It enables the CreditAccount to repay its loan balance by calling transactionService.recompense().
   - It was added to provide a way for users to settle their debts and restore available credit.

### **SavingsAccount.java**  
1. **transfer(account: Account, amount: double)**  
   -  allows a **SavingsAccount** to send money to another account within the same bank. It calls _transactionService.transferFunds()_ to process the transaction.
   -  It was added so users can transafer funds between accounts without needing to withdraw cash manually.

2. **transfer(bank: Bank, account: Account, amount: double)**  
   -  enables a **SavingsAccount** to send money to an account in a different bank, applying a processing fee. It also calls _transactionService.transferFunds()_.
   -  We added it to support interbank transfers, allowing users to send money outside their bank while ensuring feeas are applied.

3. **cashDeposit()**  
   -  allows a **SavingsAccount** to receive money by calling _transactionService.deposit()_.
   -  was added so users can increase their account balance by depositing cash into their savings account.

4. **withdrawal()**
   - lets a **SavingsAccount** take out money by calling _transactionService.withdraw()_.
   - was added so users can access their funds when needed, ensuring they can withdraw cash from their account.
5. **getAccountBalance()** 
   - returns the current balance of a **SavingsAccount**.
   - was added to let users check how much money they have in their account.

### **Bank.java**  
1. **passcode** (Attribute)
   - Prevents unauthorized access to the bankâ€™s data.
   - is added to provide a security layer for the bank and to ensure only authorized users can access or modify bank details.

2. **withdrawLimit** (Attribute)
   - Helps regulate cash flow in the bank and it also ensures users to not withdraw excessive amounts that could lead to insufficient funds.
   - is added to set a maximum amount a user can withdraw from their account at a time. To prevent large withdrawals that could cause financial instability.

3. **creditLimit** (Attribute)
   - it helps manage the bankâ€™s risk by limiting excessive credit borrowing.
   - was added to define the maximum credit (loan) a user can borrow. To prevent users from borrowing beyond what the bank can handle.
