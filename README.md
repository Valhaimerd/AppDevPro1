# AppDevPro1 (Added methods/functions) 

Transaction.java
**toString()** method was added. It formats transaction details into a readable string, including time, source account, type, and description.
Why it was added: It made transaction details easier to read and display, especially for logs or user interfaces.

Note: I will add more details later, I haven't found the rest of the newly added methods.
