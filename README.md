# AppDevPro1 (Added methods/functions) 
    
Transaction.java
    **toString()** method was added. It formats transaction details into a readable string, including time, source account, type, and description.
    Why it was added: It made transaction details easier to read and display, especially for logs or user interfaces.



We decided to add test files to test if our program was running properly and calling the right functions/methods.
List of Files Added:
**TransactionTest**
    - 
**BankTest**

Note: Will add more details later. I lost my txt file that contains all the details missing.
